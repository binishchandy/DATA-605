## SECTION 1.2

1 Let A = {a, b, c} be a sample space. Let m(a) = 1/2, m(b) = 1/3, and
m(c) = 1/6. Find the probabilities for all eight subsets of A.

```
P({a, b, c}) = m(a) + m(b) + m(c) = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/6 = 1
P({a}) = m(a) = 1/2
P({b}) = m(b) = 1/3
P({c}) = m(c) = 1/6
P({a, b}) = m(a) + m(b) = 1/2 + 1/3 = 5/6
P({a, c}) = m(a) + m(c) = 1/2 + 1/6 = 2/3
P({b, c}) = m(b) + m(c) = 1/3 + 1/6 = 1/2
P(null set) = 0
```
